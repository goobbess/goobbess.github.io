i think about reincarnation a lot. sometimes in life, i wish i could have a reset button or one of those flashy memory-wiping pens from men in black. i thought i would write about this topic so maybe i can think about it a little more.

usually, my thoughts of reincarnation are either tied to hippies doing shrooms or regrettable feelings about relationships both sexual and platonic. there are things i regret saying to my ex while we were breaking up and im sure they have their regrets as well. i feel bad about my actions and knowing somebody else knows about those bad actions makes me feel like an unorganized emotional blob. when i get in these low moods, thinking about killing myself to wipe my slate off as much as possible, i start to remember that one day were all going to die, and it makes it a little better. after a long enough period, it will likely be impossible for any trace of my remains to be found in the universe. maybe the next species of intelligent beings will use my carbon molecules as fossil fuel. (i dont know how fossil fuel works; this is just a song reference.)

roger miller has a song titled “reincarnation” that talks about the dynamics of animals in nature and how fear usually leads us to believe in such things. i have a friend who believes in reincarnation, although not in a way i understand. ill either look at old chat logs or ask them about it later. ive noticed that every person that ive seen in a first-world country that believes in reincarnation, is a big shroom fan. i think reincarnation is just an idea to cope with the fact that youre going to die someday and that youre scared of that.

recently, a stream of an ai television show caught my interest. ai scares me. i dont know how i feel about it. i found myself weirdly enjoying the show, and i want to brush it off and act like i dont think it would surpass any form of modern media, but i would be lying. humans have some form of novelty, and i think even if robots surpassed us as human beings, we would still be written in their history books as their creators. i think im scared and i know youre probably scared too. whether its ai or death, i think it is pretty safe to say that we dont know what the fuck is going on and we are freaking out.

i am having an existential crisis.

i think about what the fuck i want to type sometimes. how i would seduce a reader. if this is your porn, how would i keep you watching? sometimes i open the notepad app on my desktop and plan out the most desperate things i can say to someone i have sexual feelings for, and i do this sometimes days before sending the message i have typed up. i recently formed a relationship with a lewd streamer and currently have “mommy *** ive made so many tiny pathetic messes inside my fleshlight listening to both your sfw and nsfw content” typed up and ready to go. i think theyre going to like it. i also think the longer format of these posts is what makes it harder to feel confident in my writing when compared to sexting. im pretty much putting a multi-hundred-word sext onto the internet.

one of the sexiest moments i experienced with my ex had is when i begged them to remove their clothing. i texted them that i want to see them naked and would be happy knowing that i cant have any of it. i didnt even know i could be that erotic but in retrospect, i enjoyed and reflect on that moment a lot.

i think im going to cut this short and go masturbate.
