i think about reincarnation a lot. sometimes in life, i wish i could have a reset button or one of those flashy memory-wiping pens from men in black. i thought id write about this topic so maybe i can think about it a little more.

usually my thoughts of reincarnation are either tied to hippies doing shrooms or regrettable feelings of relationships both sexual and platonic. there are things i regret saying to my ex while we were breaking up and im sure they have their own regrets as well. i feel bad about my actions and knowing somebody else knows about those bad actions makes me feel like an unorganized emotional blob. when i get in these low moods, thinking about killing myself to wipe my slate off as much as possible, i start to remember that one day were all going to die, and it makes it a little better. after a long enough period, it will likely be impossible for any trace of my remains to be found in the universe. maybe the next species of intelligent beings will use my carbon molecules as fossil fuel. (i dont really know how fossil fuel works; this is just a song reference.)

roger miller has a song titled "reincarnation" that talks about the dynamics of animals in nature and how fear usually leads us to believe in such things. i have a friend who believes in reincarnation, although not in a way i understand. ill either look at old chat-logs or ask them about it later. you dont really see anybody but individuals who do mushrooms and believe in reincarnation in first-world countries. i think reincarnation is just an idea to cope with the fact that youre going to die someday and that youre scared of that.

recently, a stream of an ai television show has caught my interest. ai scares me. i dont know how i feel about it. i found myself weirdly enjoying the show, and i want to brush it off and act like i dont think it would surpass any form of modern media, but i would by lying. humans have some form of novelty, and i think even if robots surpassed us as human beings, we would still be written in their history books as their creators.

this post is clearly me having an existential crisis.

i think about what the fuck i want to type sometimes. how i would seduce a reader. if this is your porn, how would i keep you watching? sometimes i open the notepad app on my desktop and plan out the most desperate things i can say to someone i have sexual feelings for, and i do this sometimes days prior. i recently formed a relationship with a lewd streamer and currently have "mommy *** ive made so many tiny pathetic messes inside my fleshlight listening to both your sfw and nsfw content" typed up and ready to go. i think theyre going to like it. i think the longer format of these posts are what make it harder to feel confident. im pretty much putting a multi-hundred word sext onto the internet.

one of the sexiest moments me and my ex had is when i begged them to remove their clothing. i texted them that i want to see them naked and would be happy knowing that i cant have any of it. i didnt even know i could be that erotic but in retrospect i enjoyed that moment a lot.

i think im going to cut this short and go masturbate.
