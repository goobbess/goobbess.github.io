i dont find most femboys attractive. i myself am a retired femboy. i still look the same but i dont think of gender the same way. there is only a subsect of femboys i enjoy looking at and those are the ones like myself. fluffy hair and baggy clothes. anime femboys are also nice most of the time. i also just dont like the word femboy. so ill title this post mascgirls.

i find the r/femboy subreddit to be a groomer subreddit. the rules state that the subreddit is an 18+ subreddit but its not even in 18+ mode. im also not sure this was always a rule. when i was posting on the subreddit i was met with multiple minors messaging me and desiring sexual relationships with me. seems kind of fucked up, huh? while i know you cant keep all of the bad things out i just dont think it tries enough. femboys are a dress style that cater to the younger generation so i think not clearly seperating the adults from the children is fucked up and irresponsible. i think ddlg is fine but it should be taken seriously who is participating in those communities because i think it would be easy for children to wander into those spaces.

on the topic of reddit i also want to say that i hate the amount of censorship they engage in. half of the porn that i find intersting isnt allowed.

although i dont find femboys hot, i find the idea of girls being into femboys hot. i think its so nice that girls just want a girly little plaything that happens to have a dick. its lewd.

i heard a theory from another femboy and they said that femboys are just incels that figured out a way to get pussy. and i like that theory.

i feel like this posts stems from a great hatred towards men. which inadvertedly is somewhat self-hatred.
