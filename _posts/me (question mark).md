me or the ps5?

i usually see this question when girls use it as a caption to their sexy photos. i think its misogynistic. you're trying to make people think "would i love/make love to this chick or get a ps5?" and both answers are bad. i think one is a pretty boring, dehumanizing and misogynistic way to view women. i think the other is a boring, dehumanizing and misogynistic way to view women.

i also don't really care about you or the ps5 and that also makes me feel conflicted. i think pc is fine enough for me and i don't really need you in my life. but am i a misogynist for not wanting this hot catgirl in my life? i don't know.
