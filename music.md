ill put music here

first beat i was happy with. some issues with the file due to not owning the full version of fl studio.

<audio controls>
  <source src="mp3/haunt.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
    <source src="mp3/haunt.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
    <p><a href="mp3/haunt.mp3">link to the audio until i figure out embeds</a>
  </p>
</audio>

second beat i was happy with. major improvement. not the complete thing because i didnt save and dont own full version of fl studio.

<audio controls>
  <source src="mp3/dododo.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
    <source src="mp3/dododo.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
    <p><a href="mp3/dododo.mp3">link to the audio until i figure out embeds</a>
